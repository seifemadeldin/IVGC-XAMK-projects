# 🎮 IVGC Projects – Introduction to Video Games Creation  

## 📜 About This Repository  
This repository contains all my projects from the **Introduction to Video Games Creation (IVGC)** course at **XAMK**. Throughout the course, I explored various aspects of game development, including **game design, programming, 3D modeling, pixel art, and game engine development**.  

Each project in this repository reflects a different aspect of game development, from simple mechanics to full-fledged game concepts.  

## 📂 Project List  

### 🃏 Merlin's Demon War  
**Genre:** 2D Turn-Based Card Game  
Merlin's Demon War is a **strategic 1v1 card battle game** where players fight against powerful **Fire and Ice demons**. The game focuses on **mana management**, **turn-based combat**, and **card abilities**, including **attacks, healing, and a powerful ultimate move**. Strategy and timing are key to victory!

This project is a **custom game engine** built specifically for creating **2D visual novels**. It allows for interactive storytelling, dialogue systems, and scene transitions, providing a framework for narrative-driven games.  

### 🏗️ Module 1 – 3D Model Importing  
A simple **technical project** where I imported and optimized a **3D model from Blender into Unity**. This module introduced **asset management, material application, and scene integration**.  

### 🎨 Module 4 – Pixel Art & Level Design  
A hands-on **pixel art and level design project** focused on **creating environments and character sprites** for a game. This module involved **tilesets, color theory, and game world structuring**.
